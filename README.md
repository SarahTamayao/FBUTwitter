- [X] Be able to refresh data by pulling down on the Table View
- [X] Be able to like and retweet from their Timeline view

- [X] Each tweet should display user profile picture, username, screen name, tweet text, timestamp, as well as buttons and labels for favorite, reply, and retweet counts.
- [X] Compose and post a tweet from a Compose Tweet view, launched from a Compose button on the Nav bar.
- [X] See Tweet details in a Details view
- [X] App should render consistently all views and subviews in recent iPhone models and all orientations

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Click on links that appear in Tweets
- [ ] See embedded media in Tweets that contain images or videos

- [X] Switch between timeline, mentions, or profile view through a tab bar
- [ ] Profile Page: pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Tweets from users with protected accounts (tweets that you can't retweet) have greyed out and disabled retweet buttons.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Multiple custom cells in table views.
2. Dynamically changing table view cells/their content. For ex. with adding images to table view cells when you don't know whether or not there will be images or how many there will be.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I wanted to add the number of replies a tweet had to my tweet cell (along with # of favorites and # of retweets) but reply_count "is only available with the Premium and Enterprise tier products" and so I struggled with why it was returning 0 for a minute. Also, I didn't know that you could have multiple different custom table view cells within a table view so I struggled with how to implement the profile tab before finding this out from my manager (shout-out Kyle).
